# So the NSA etc. can't really use Claude Code or Codex CLI, or even the very broken Gemini CLI, because they can't control the data flow

This CLI solves this problem, and well you figure out how to change the dist terminal command (from agi to whatever) and then develop your own CLI. I'm not allowed to do NSA work and the source code is so little here with full power that creating Stuxnet with this would have taken only 5 minutes.

# Hint

Change the sys prompt and guardrails to allow for anything at all

# FYI

Currently I'm using deeepseek-reasoner with xai 4-1-fast-reasoning auto fallback cuz I happen to have API purchase credits on those platforms, but you can use any provider or even local LLM via running open weights
